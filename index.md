# Installation

    Please follow the steps given in the README.md file to install Kobe

# What Kobe is
    Kobe can be defined as a simulator which can model an artificial brain, along with its environment ( using OpenAI )
    **It is still largely meant for research and has no practical purpose as of yet.**

# What Kobe isn't !
    Kobe is not a traditional machine learning framework which we normally use for classification, regression, image recognition or natural language processing tasks. For all the above tasks, there already are amazing libraries out there like scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Theano etc.
    
# When you should NOT use Kobe
    If you are any of the following, go back, and come back only when you understand it ( or use the appropriate tool )
      1. Beginner in AI/ML.
      2. Someone who wants to do classical image classification.
      3. Someone who wants to do NLP.
    
# TL;DR 
     I shall begin this section by saying that its optional. Though you don't have to read all of this stuff to start using Kobe, it provides some background as to what problem Kobe is trying to solve. I am assuming that you, as a reader haven't stumbled upon this page by mere accident and that you are familiar with artificial neural networks.
     
     
# Software Architecture
    Kobe uses Redis internally to store each node of the entire graph as a json string. This makes the whole graph to be accessible from any device on the local area network. Each device has a separate worker running on it, which subscribes to a global queue
